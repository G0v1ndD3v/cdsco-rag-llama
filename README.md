# CDSCO-RAG-LLaMA
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that scrapes drug approval documents from the official website of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), performs semantic retrieval over the processed content, and uses the LLaMA 3.2 language model to generate context-aware responses based on the retrieved information.
